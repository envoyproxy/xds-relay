// Package orchestrator is responsible for instrumenting inbound xDS client
// requests to the correct aggregated key, forwarding a representative request
// to the upstream origin server, and managing the lifecycle of downstream and
// upstream connections and associates streams. It implements
// go-control-plane's Cache interface in order to receive xDS-based requests,
// send responses, and handle gRPC streams.
//
// This file manages the bookkeeping of upstream responses by tracking the
// aggregated key and its corresponding receiver channel for upstream
// responses. The contents of this file are intended to only be used within the
// orchestrator module and should not be exported.
