// Package orchestrator is responsible for instrumenting inbound xDS client
// requests to the correct aggregated key, forwarding a representative request
// to the upstream origin server, and managing the lifecycle of downstream and
// upstream connections and associates streams. It implements
// go-control-plane's Cache interface in order to receive xDS-based requests,
// send responses, and handle gRPC streams.
//
// This file manages the bookkeeping of downstream clients by tracking inbound
// requests to their corresponding response channels. The contents of this file
// are intended to only be used within the orchestrator module and should not
// be exported.
